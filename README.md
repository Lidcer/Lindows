## How to?

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Usage

- `npm run dev` - Client and server are in watch mode with source maps, opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run test` - Runs jest tests
- `npm run link` - Runs es-lint
- `npm run build` - `dist` folder will include all the needed files, both client (Bundle) and server.
- `npm start` - Just runs `node ./dist/server/server.js`
- `npm start:prod` - sets `NODE_ENV` to `production` and then runs `node ./dist/server/server.js`. (Bypassing webpack proxy)
